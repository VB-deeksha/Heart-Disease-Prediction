# Heart-Disease-Prediction

## Work flow :
Intial process the data-set for compatible for our Machine Learning Algorithm.(Data Pre-Processing)
After processing, split the data into training data and testing data.
Feed the training data to Logistic Regression ML model. Its function is making binary data like whether the person is having disease or not.
After completion of evaluation, the trained Logistic Regression model is ready.
Finally we provide new data to trained model and then it will predict whether the person is healthy or heart defect.
